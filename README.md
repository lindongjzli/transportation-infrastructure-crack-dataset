After removing duplicate, blurred, and invalid images, a total of 72,805 images were systematically annotated and divided into subsets, resulting in the construction of the first transportation infrastructure crack dataset that covers multiple scenarios, granularities, and modalities. To ensure the standardization and high quality of the annotations, the study follows the principle of data balance by removing long-tail categories. Specifically, crack categories with annotation counts less than one-tenth that of the most frequently annotated category were excluded from each subset. Additionally, all images in each subset were standardized to a resolution of 640x640 pixels before conducting statistical analysis of subclass-level annotation distributions. The annotation statistics for each crack category are summarized in Table 5.
